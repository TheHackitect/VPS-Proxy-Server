## Overview

**“Dark-Mode VPN/Proxy Server”** is a powerful yet intuitive tool that transforms a standard VPS into a robust, feature‑rich proxy server. Built in **Python/Flask**, it provides a sleek web dashboard with real-time usage analytics, user management, ban/unban controls, data limits, and much more—while keeping it all wrapped in a modern, dark-themed UI.
